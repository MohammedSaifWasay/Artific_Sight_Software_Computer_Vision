# 🧠 Multi-Object Detection & Emotion Recognition with AI Surveillance

This project demonstrates a real-time AI-based surveillance system capable of:
- Multi-object detection and counting
- Social distancing assessment
- Face mask detection
- Human emotion recognition

The system uses **Machine Learning**, **Image Processing**, and **Neural Networks**, developed using Python and OpenCV. A supporting Android app named **"Artific Sight Intelligence Application"** is also part of the system.
